<br /> B. One Hot Encoding
<br /> C. Linear Regression, LASSO, Ridge
<br /> D. Cross Validation


<br /> WORKOUT 2 - DeepNN using TensorFlow
<br /> A. Read MNIST data from .csv files
<br /> B. Implement Deep Learning with RELU activation units
<br /> C. Experiment with Regularization such as, Dropouts or L2 Loss


<br /> WORKOUT 3 - Logistic Regression by Stochastic Gradient Descent
<br /> A. 
<br /> B. 
<br /> C. 


<br /> WORKOUT 4 - Character-based Language Markov Models
<br /> A. Use twitter database to build a model that can predict the language of the tweet
<br /> B. Related probability tables are created for every language subset in the training database
<br /> C. These tables are applied to predict the language of the tweet in the validation database
